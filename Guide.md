Adding a module to your Android app involves several steps. I'll guide you through the process with instructions and include some images to help illustrate the steps.

1. Open Android Studio:

    Start by opening Android Studio, the integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.

2. Open Your Project:

    Open your existing Android project in Android Studio or create a new one if you haven't already.

3. Open Project Structure:

    Click on "File" in the top menu bar.
    Select "Project Structure" from the dropdown menu.

    Android Studio will sync your project's Gradle files to update the dependencies.

10. Configure Your App to Use the Module:

    Depending on the purpose of your module (e.g., ads integration, utilities), you may need to follow specific configuration steps outlined in your module's documentation.

That's it! You've successfully added a module to your Android app in Android Studio. Remember to configure your app to use the module according to its specific requirements.
